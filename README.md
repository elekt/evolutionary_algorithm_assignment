# Evolutionary computing

Our research question was about testing the quality of different evolutionary algorithm techniques.
Our solution divided from the master branch to 3 algorithms that we tested:

- base_algorithm contains the code for benchmark code
- crowding_algorithm contains the code for the crowding algorithm code
- islands_algorithm contains the code for the islands implementation

The reason for such distinction was to make sure that the key differences in the implementations can be clearly pointed out. And that in the final rush we don't mess up each others work.

To run the selected technique run "./build_run.sh" from the branch to be tested. Different parameters can be changed in that file too to alter the run of the solution.
